abstract: From short scripts to vast simulations of Earth's climate, protein structures or even the cosmos, it is hard to imagine scientific research without software. Scientists use software code in myriad ways -to plan experiments; to record, organize, analyse, visualize and archive data; to control scientific instruments, and more. But software evolves. Most open-source software used in research is refined both iteratively and collectively, and has no published 'version of record'. Updates can target various versions and releases, meaning that each aspect of the software -the project as a whole, a specific version or a single file -can require a different way to refer to it. This creates confusion. And so software comes with a double bind: like data, it supports the findings of a study and should be preserved and published. Yet it should also remain available and supported, and possibly be improved, over time. Scholars, librarians, research institutions and funding agencies are wrestling with how to reconcile these two requirements.
