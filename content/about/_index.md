      title: Our Origins
      text: |
        Born from a French manifesto, then a European one, this collaborative project aims to put software engineering back at the heart of the concerns of the various national, European, and international calls for projects, increasingly exclusively focused on applications and no longer on fundamentals. It therefore does not benefit from historical collaboration at the scale of research groups or institutions but precisely proposes to fill a gap in this area by starting from the collaborations and interpersonal relationships of the participants contacted.

      title: The Software Challenge
      text: |
        Software has become fundamental to (and omnipresent in) our society. No aspect of society is not enabled or mediated by software, and industry leaders have proclaimed that "every business is now a software company." Additionally, software greatly boosts scientific progress and underpins many of our critical infrastructures (like electricity or telecommunications).

        However, the complexity of software continues to increase. The total volume of software is growing at an exponential rate. Software is ubiquitous but remains extremely difficult to build and maintain effectively. Even more to guarantee their accuracy, reliability and performance. Europe has been at the forefront with many innovations in software but now risks falling behind. The ever-increasing size and complexity of software, and the explosion in the use of AI, urgently require new techniques and principles to address the software challenges of the future, preserve autonomy and Europe's sovereignty, and protect fundamental values ​​such as privacy, security, fairness, and inclusion.

        These problems do not solve themselves but require fundamental research. Now is the time to increase funding for software research. To start a conversation and raise awareness of the importance of software research, this international research network aims to bring together actors from different countries who share this observation by connecting researchers, but above all, the equivalent of research groups (GdR) of the CNRS in these different countries in order to share good ideas and pool joint efforts.
